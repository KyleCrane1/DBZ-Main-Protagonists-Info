The ability to become a Super Saiyan was once considered to be nothing but a legend, as it had not been performed for over one thousand years.Vegeta stated that a Super Saiyan has achieved a level of power so overwhelming that it could only be maintained in a transformed state. Despite only being told through legend, Frieza, who had Saiyans in his army, became paranoid over the possibility of truth behind the legend due to the constantly growing power of the Saiyan race. After receiving informal permission from the God of Destruction Beerus, Frieza finally decided to annihilate the Saiyan race by destroying Planet Vegeta,hus apparently sparking the end of the Super Saiyan legend. However, twenty-five years later, the Super Saiyan legend was proven true when Goku accomplished the feat during his titanic battle with Frieza

	<p class="lol"><b>This is a Super Sayian 2,First Debut in Dragon Ball Z Episode 299,The transformation into a Super Saiyan 2, like its predecessor, isn't a drastic one. The hallmarks of the Super Saiyan 2 transformation are more golden and rigid hair than the Super Saiyan transformation. The Saiyan's aura becomes more violent, while also gaining bursts of plasma within the aura.
		n order for a Super Saiyan to become a Super Saiyan 2 they must experience an extreme rage or emotion, akin to the Super Saiyan transformation, or achieve it through methods of training. Any previous emotional mastery of Super Saiyan Fourth Grade is negated upon first entry into Super Saiyan 2. As such, the Saiyan as to once again further hone their emotional control to negate the ruthlessness in this form. According to Gokū, this form comes with the " back tingling" feeling that accompanied the first Super Saiyan form.
The Super Saiyan 2 transformation, surpasses the Super Saiyan's speed, strength, and power, eliminating the need to balance between power, speed, strength, and stamina with previous derivatives of the Super Saiyan transformation. In terms of power, the Super Saiyan 2 is twice as strong as the Super Saiyan
Personality wise, the transformation is far more extreme. When Gohan first transformed into a Super Saiyan 2, he became overcome with grief and rage due to his human emotions. It turned a hesitant-to-fight Gohan into and all out warrior with an insatiable desire for revenge. Additionally, Gohan's desire for battle was increased, to the point that he initially refuses Gokū's pleas to finish off Cell in his Perfect Form. At the same time, the Saiyan experiences increases in his arrogance to the point of extremely rash behavior. Gohan, for instance, initially only tortured Cell rather than finish him off.

Goku returns to his normal state, prompting Majin Buu to ask whether or not they are still going to play. Goku reassures him that they will get to it once he has taught them a thing or two about Super Saiyans, though Babidi still seems uninterested. Before powering up, Goku explains that he is currently in his normal state. Then Goku powers up to a Super Saiyan and explains that he is currently a Super Saiyan. After that, he powers up to the next level. Goku explains that his current form is a Super Saiyan who has ascended past a Super Saiyan, dubbing the form "Super Saiyan 2" for the first time. Babidi brushes it off, claiming that Goku just changed his hair and he calls it a useless transformation.As Goku continues to power up, his immense power is affecting the climate around the world. The wind starts to blow heavily and the Earth is shaking as well. Goku begins to transform; his hair slowly beginning to grow longer. The immense power that he is generating slowly blows Babidi away from him. Back at Grand Kai's Planet, King Kai pleads for Goku to stop.

At a nearby city, the glass of office buildings and street signs start breaking. Televisions sets are exploding due to Goku's high energy output. From a mountain area, Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu also notice Goku's power. Tien gasps that it feels like the planet is shaking apart and he protests that Goku will destroy the world if he doesn't stop. Back at the site of the World Martial Arts Tournament, Mr. Satan is busy dodging falling weights as the ground shakes.
With a mighty scream, Goku lets his power explode as he pushes his energy level to the maximum in a brilliant flash of light. Babidi has to shield his eyes to prevent himself from being blinded by the immense light, but when he uncovers his eyes, he gasps as he sees what Goku is now. Goku is no longer the man he was. His orange gi shimmers with a tremendous aura of power. His hair has grown all the way down to his waist, and his eyebrows are gone

	<p class="lol"><b>First Debut in Dragon Ball Super Epissode 114,Super Saiyan God is a Saiyan transformation that grants the user godly ki, providing them with a power boost beyond Super Saiyan 3 and its predecessors. It is initially obtained through a ritual involving six righteous Saiyans or special divine training.
		Trained users can further combine this form with the first Super Saiyan transformation, attaining the more powerful,
The "Super Saiyan God" is the legend among legends of the warrior race, the Saiyans. The power of six good-hearted Saiyans must be infused for one of them to achieve this legendary form. As Shenron explains to the Dragon Team and company, a Super Saiyan God once appeared on Planet Vegeta to stop the evil Saiyans but he failed because of the form's time limit. The Namekians were aware of the Super Saiyan God and wrote of the method to achieve the form in their book of legends. When in this form, the Saiyan's general appearance has only slight differences: the most notable change is the slight pink skin tone (similar to the usage of <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Rage_Mode" target="_blank">Rage Mode</a>) and hair that is a shade of red.

In this form, Goku possesses magenta-red hair (identical to his fur as a <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Saiyan_4" target="_blank">Super Saiyan 4</a>) while Vegeta possesses crimson red hair.[5] The hair retains its natural style but becomes more refined (losing any stray hairs). The Saiyan's eyes become more detailed and the irises become red (appearing as more relaxed even in battle until sufficiently angered). The overall body structure appears to become younger and thinner in frame and build. The aura of the Super Saiyan God resembles a raging fire.

A Saiyan becomes cool-headed when in this form.[6]

		<p class="lol"><b>First Debut in Dragon Ball Z:Ressuruction F Episode 14,Super Saiyan Blue,also known as Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, is a form that combines the power of Super Saiyan God with the first Super Saiyan form.
		This form can be accessed by absorbing the powers of a god, activating them and then transforming into a Super Saiyan, or through vigorous ki control training with a deity with godly ki and then obtaining that Godly ki for oneself, as seen with Vegeta in the Super anime. This form surpasses its predecessor, Super Saiyan God,
uper Saiyan Blue boasts a vibrant, fiery, electric blue aura, as opposed to the blazing orange aura of Super Saiyan God. The aura surrounding the Super Saiyan Blue form also appears to be glittering somewhat, with small sparkling particles of energy traveling upwards within the flames, with occasional surges of electricity. If one inspects closely, a very subtle yellow glow can be seen on the outside of the aura as well. It was not directly stated why this is present, but it could be remnants of the original Super Saiyan transformation. This dual colored aura resembles that of Trunks' <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Rage" target="_blank">Super Saiyan Rage form</a>. Unlike the main Super Saiyan transformations, the user's body does not glow in Blue form without an aura. In Dragon Ball Super: Broly, this subtle glow is omitted entirely.

When the user first transforms, they are enveloped by an aura of white energy, leaving a dark silhouette of themselves in it. They are then surrounded by a shell of blue ki which cracks and breaks apart, revealing the transformed user within, before the fiery aura explodes forth. Most subsequent transformations behave like an ordinary Super Saiyan, in which the user's hair rises and turns blue.

However, angels like <a href="https://dragonballuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Whis">Whis</a> appear to have mastered it. As a result, it is known as the "state of the gods"

Despite this, <a href="https://dragonballuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Beerus">Beerus</a> and the other gods recognize the transformation's completed form, hinting that it might not be completely unique to <a href="#Goku">Gokū.</a>
		Most users of Ultra Instinct, such as <a href="https://dragonballuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Whis">Whis</a>, do not display a noticeable difference when using the technique. However, <a href="#Goku">Son Gokū</a> and <a href="https://dragonballuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Moro">Moro</a> adopt a unique transformation when using it. When the technique fully manifests, <a href="#Goku">Gokū</a>>'s eyes and hair become a distinctive silver coloration. His hair remains raised slightly and his aura remains crystalline—though, in addition to blues and whites, it now sports purple and red hues as well and is noticeably brighter.In the manga, the <a href="https://dragonballuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Hakaishin">Hakaishin</a> <a href="https://dragonballuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Beerus">Beerus</a> notes that any god would recognize this form as the technique Ultra Instinct.This seems to be the case in the anime as well, as <a href="https://dragonballuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Whis">Whis></a> and <a href="https://dragonballuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Beerus">Beerus</a> both recognize it and the Hakaishin from each universe stand to acknowledge
